I'm an Android Engineer 

My favourite thing to talk about is tech startups and how tech helps solves problems around us.

I am currently taking a deep dive into custom views in android and would very much love to talk about it

I love writing and i you can view some of my articles in [Medium](https://esambooks.medium.com/) which is a little bit of everything and my tech articles in [dev.to](https://dev.to/kolanse)

After a long hard day of coding i usually relax by watching anime and reading tech blogs
